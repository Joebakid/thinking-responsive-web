        On December 28, 2021, Pi Network launched the Enclosed Mainnet along
        with new chapters of the updated Pi white paper that cover the Pi Token
        Model, and Mining Mechanism, and Roadmap. These chapters are in draft
        form and continue to update based on community feedback and data
        gathered during the Enclosed Mainnet period.

      <h3 class="mining">MINING</h3>
      <p>
        Pi makes crypto mining easy Breakthrough tech allows you to mine Pi on
        your phone without draining your battery. When reviewing community
        applications, the Pi Core Team (CT) will look for polished projects that
        adhere to the below criteria: Current usability and accessibility
        Workable and useful utilities No detrimental bugs Refined user flow and
        experience Increase in Pioneers’ engagement User growth for the app
        itself and the Pi Platform through organic growth mechanisms Community
        ratings Transaction ability through proper integration of Test-Pi
        Moreover, CT has listed the types of applications we would love to see
        built. Our list is split into two categories — 
        <ol>
          <li>CT-supported high priority apps</li>
          <li>other community-focused apps.</li>
          
        </ol>
         
      </p>

      <h3 class="mining">ROADMAP</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Phase 1: Beta</li>
        <li>Phase 2: Testnet</li>
        <li>Phase 3: Mainnet</li>
        <li>The Enclosed Network Period</li>
