                    <span class="rat">
                    I used to be a pack rat.</span> I had so many things that I thought
                     that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate 
                     any of it because there was too much. <br><br> Things were terrible.
                      I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live 
                      in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. </p> <br>
                      
                    <h3 class="subtitle"> How I turned things around </h3>  
                     <p>
                       <span class="rat">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of 
                        everything.</span>  I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, 
                        sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                         It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
                          place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

                     <h3 class="subtitle"> Now I live  the simple life </h3> 
                     <p>
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so 
                        much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I 
                        have more free time to enjoy. With how much it turned my life around,
                       <span class="rat">I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</span>  , and
                          how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which
                           is why I started this site!
